****install****

sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql

****Check****

The installation process created an operating system user called postgres(Default Administrative User) 
to match the postgres database administrative account. To log into PostgreSQL with the psql client, 
use sudo to run the command as the postgres user:

sudo -u postgres psql
\quit

sudo -u -: tells sudo to run cammand as a specific user
postgres -: Default Administrative User of PostgreSQL
pasql -: start postgresql interactive terminal

****Create a Local Database****
1. service postgresql start
2. psql -U postgres -: Connect to psql as -U(user) postgres, Needs peer authentication.
    
    ****PEER AUTHENTICATION****
    PostgreSQL attempts to match the OS user with the PostgreSQL user. For instance, if you're logged in as the 
    postgres OS user, PostgreSQL expects you to be connecting as the postgres PostgreSQL user.
    
    No Password Required: If the OS user matches the PostgreSQL user, no password is required. 
    PostgreSQL assumes that if the OS user has the necessary permissions to connect to PostgreSQL, 
    they should be allowed to access the database without further authentication.

    The method for peer authentication is specified in PostgreSQL's configuration file pg_hba.conf. 
    This file controls how clients are authenticated and is usually located in the PostgreSQL data 
    directory (e.g., /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf).

    sudo -u postgres psql
3. CREATE DATABASE DWA;

    ****Warn****
    DETAIL:  The template database was created using collation version 2.38, but the operating system provides 
    version 2.39.
    HINT:  Rebuild all objects in the template database that use the default collation and run ALTER DATABASE 
    template1 REFRESH COLLATION VERSION, or build PostgreSQL with the right library version.
    ****info****
    Collation version refers to the specific version of the collation rules used by the system to sort and compare 
    textual data. These versions can differ based on the operating system's libraries and the database system's version.

    Databases like PostgreSQL rely on operating system libraries for collation rules. For instance, Linux systems 
    often use the GNU libc library, which includes collation data.
    The version of these libraries (e.g., glibc on Linux) affects how text is sorted and compared.

    -> ALTER DATABASE template1 REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;
        ****info****
            ALTER DATABASE: used to make changes to the template1 database.

            template1: special database in PostgreSQL that serves as the default template for creating new databases. 
                        When a new database is created, it is typically based on the template1 database, 
                        so any changes to template1 affect all newly created databases.

            REFRESH COLLATION VERSION: It instructs PostgreSQL to update the collation version information.

4. Change peer authentication(peer) to password(md5) in /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf's "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    
    sudo systemctl reload postgresql
    sudo -u postgres psqlpg_lsclusters

    ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'admin'; 
    CREATE DATABASE webdata_Analyzer OWNER  postgres;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE webdata_analyzer TO postgres;

    **** If fails ****
    sudo -u postgres psql -c "\l" -> check the available database

    psql -U postgres -d webdata_analyzer -h localhost -W 
        -W(when prompted password is same as postgres password)
